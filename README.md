# Google-Docs-List-Styler
A simple Google Docs script that iterates through all list items and styles it with a paragraph style. Useful for styling transcripts such that the interviewerâ€™s questions are quickly scannable.

# How to use
This script is written to be used within specific Google documents.

To use it, simple open Tools > Script editor from within your document, and paste the code into the text editor that appears. 

Then, run the onOpen function to initialize the script within our UI. This will show a custom menu in our Google Docs editor.

If you want to run the script directly without the UI, run the listStyler function.
